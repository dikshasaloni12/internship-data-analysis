# Internship Data Analytics Project ðŸ§ ðŸ“Š

This Jupyter Notebook was developed during my internship, where I explored business data to uncover insights around product performance, revenue trends, and customer behavior.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- Python (for calculations and data exploration)
- Tableau & Power BI (for dashboard creation)
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data analysis and visualization)

## ðŸ“ˆ What the Notebook Includes
- Revenue and transaction analysis
- Product performance metrics
- Calculated fields and custom KPIs
- Data cleaning and transformation steps
- Visualizations to highlight trends and insights

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Matters
The goal of the project was to build structured dashboards and dig deeper into business metrics that support meaningful decision-making. I focused not just on presenting data â€” but on building visuals that reveal patterns and performance fairly and clearly.

## ðŸ’¡ About Me
I care deeply about authenticity and fairness in both professional spaces and data interpretation. This project was a chance to combine my analytical skills with my values, and Iâ€™m excited to share it.

Feel free to explore the notebook â€” feedback and thoughtful discussion always welcome!
