# Mortality Age Analysis by Handedness

## Project Overview
This internship project explores potential correlations between handedness (left or right) and age at death. The analysis was conducted using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, and the final codebase is hosted on GitHub in a zipped format for review and replication.

## Repository Structure
- `notebook.zip`: Contains the completed Jupyter Notebook with all relevant code cells, comments, and output visualizations.
- Data files (if included): Located within the zipped folder and loaded directly in the notebook.

## Objective
To assess whether handedness influences lifespan by analyzing mortality data and performing statistical tests, with the goal of uncovering meaningful trends or confirming neutrality.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Language**: Python
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook (via MedTourEasy platform)
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization
  - `scipy.stats` for hypothesis testing

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing including null handling and feature selection
- Comparative analysis of age at death segmented by handedness
- Stratified insights by gender and other available demographics
- Statistical testing (e.g., t-tests or ANOVA) to check significance
- Interpretation of visual trends and anomalies

## Key Findings
Preliminary observations suggest marginal differences in lifespan linked to handedness. However, further exploration with broader datasets is recommended to confirm consistency and rule out confounding variables.

## How to Use
1. Download the `notebook.zip` file from the GitHub repository
2. Extract the contents and open the `.ipynb` file in any Jupyter Notebook-compatible environment
3. Execute code cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis
4. Review plots and statistical outputs embedded within the notebook
